# Baby-Tracker
After my wife became pregnant I got the idea to make a tracker for her to journal her thoughts and feelings while experiencing the pregnancy.  

This is my first version of the application.  

Currently there is no GUI, and the information is saved to a table created locally on a database.  

However, next version will include the ability to create the table within the app if one has not been created.  

Application uses Javax.Swing and SQL with pop up dialog boxes currently.
